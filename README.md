# DataStructures
University project: Implementation &amp; usage of data structures in C++. 

## Summary
This repository is a collection of different coding exercises to understand the concept behind both linear and non-linear data structures. `Stack` uses the `Vector` class but all the others use custom `Node` objects and memory allocation for the implementation. For all of them, a `main` code is attached to solve some small problem with a view to show how the implemented classes are used.
